# Java Script Rule Engine (JSRE)

JSRE is a simple rule engine for java. The focus is the ease of use to create applications 
that need to execute simple rules, which shall be editable by business stakeholders.

JSRE offers you to use a JSON file to describe input, applied rules and output.

A typical case to use JSRE would be, that you have some business rules, e.g. for configurators
or software assisten applications, that shall be configured by business stake holders
and you would like to avoid the complexity of Drools or other business rule management systems.

An easy usage could be creating a simple http-json (restful) webservice, which passes
the requests data directly to the rule engine and the response back to the client.
This way you can easily integrate your businessrules e.g. to your javascript frontend.


## Example usage:
The usage within your java application can be done as follows:

```
String json = "{ ... my json configuration ... }";	//your configuration file content (json)
Map<String, Object> input = new HashMap<String, Input>();	//your rule engine input data
input.put("firstName", "John");
RuleEngine re = RuleEngineFactory.getEngine(json);
re.setInput(input);
re.executeRules();
String output = re.getJsonDocument();
```

## Example configration:

test.json:
```
{
	"version" : "1.1",
	
	"inputValidation" : [
		{
			"name" : "firstName",
			"type" : "String",
			"mandatory" : false,
			"expression" : "John"
		},
	],
	"document" : {
		"greeting" : "Hello, who ever you are. Nice to meet you!"
	},
	"rules" : [
		{
			"expression" : "input.firstName == 'John'",
			"description" : "This is some explaining text: Special greetings for John",
			"priority" : 1,
			"scriptActions" : [
				"document.greeting = 'Hey John! How are you?'"
			]
		},
		{
			"expression" : "typeof input.firstName === 'undefined'",
			"description" : "If noone passes a name in, we will just greet the world.",
			"priority" : 2,
			"scriptActions" : [
				"document.greeting = 'Hello World!'"
			]
		},
	]
}
```

## Example output
The output of the above example would look like:
```
{
	"greeting" : "Hey John! How are you?"
}
```
For passing in any other name than John, e.g. Jake, the answer would look like:
```
{
	"greeting" : "Hello, who ever you are. Nice to meet you!"
}
```
If no name is passed in as parameter, the answer will be:
```
{
	"greeting" : "Hello World!"
}
```


## Usage of the rule engine cache

Most likely you will use the same configuration over and over again to answer requests. 
In this case you probably want to cache the configuration to speed up your process.
If you are not going to cache the configuration the configuration has to be compiled
for every new rule engine you create. If you use the provided rule engine cache,
this is not needed anymore. This normaly speeds up the evaluation time with configurations
of size > 4kb down to 10% of the execution time.

There are a few things you need to do to use the rule engine cache classes:

1. You need to register a rule engine provider, which describes how to get the json content
and how to configure your engine.
Example:

  ```
  RuleEngineCache.registerRuleEngineProvider(new BasicRuleEngineProvider() {

	@Override
	public String getConfigurationContent(String filename) throws IOException {
		return ResourceFileHelper.getFileContent(filename);
	}

	@Override
	protected void configureEngine(RuleEngine ruleEngine) {
		//configure your rule engine here, e.g. register java actions. 
	}
  });
  ```
  
2. You need to use the rule engine cache class to get (and build) the engines:
  
  ```
  String configFile = "the file name of the configuration you would like to use."; //this is used as the key for the cache
  RuleEngine re = RuleEngineCache.get().getLockedRuleEngine(configFile);
  ```
  
3. You go on like in the none cache example from above:
  
  ```
  Map<String, Object> input = new HashMap<String, Input>();	//your rule engine input data
  input.put("firstName", "John");
  re.setInput(input);
  re.executeRules();
  String output = re.getJsonDocument();
  ```

4. Last but not least you need to unlock the rule engine. This will tell the cache,
that this specific instance is not used anymore and can be provided to other threads
requesting a configuration with that filename.

  ```
  RuleEngineCache.get().unlock(re);
  ```

## Pre-, Post-Execution
Sometimes you need to execute code before applying the rules or most likely after the rules have been applied.
This can for instance be used to calculate sums and add them to the document.
In this cases you can use the "postExecution" or "preExecution" fields.
Example:
```
	"postExecution" : [
		"document.totalPrice += document.ghz[input.ghzOption].price"
	]
```
